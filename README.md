# Project 1: Code with Arduino
//Note: everything is present inside code_with_arduino_1 directory
## Overview
This project is designed to run on Arduino-compatible hardware using PlatformIO as the development environment. The code is written in C++ and organized into `.cpp` and `.h` files, following standard C++ conventions. There is no `.ino` file, as the project is structured for advanced development workflows.

## Features
- Modular C++ codebase for better maintainability.
- Compatible with PlatformIO for streamlined development and deployment.
- Designed for Arduino-compatible microcontrollers.

## Requirements
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) installed in your IDE (e.g., VS Code).
- A compatible Arduino board.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in your IDE with PlatformIO installed.
3. Build and upload the project to your Arduino-compatible board.

## File Structure
- `src/`: Contains the `.cpp` and `.h` source files and header files.
- `platformio.ini`: Configuration file for PlatformIO.

## How to Build
1. Open the project in PlatformIO.
2. Select the appropriate environment for your board in `platformio.ini`.
3. Click on the "Build" button to compile the code.
4. Upload the compiled code to your board.
